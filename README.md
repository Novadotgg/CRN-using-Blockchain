# CRN-using-Blockchain
Blockchain and cognitive radio networks based project where the Blockchain technology used to secure the Cognitive radio network from SSDF attack...
I used ganache here as my ehtherium network.
All the gases used and all the demo etherium used to be deducted from ganache, it gave me a kind of UI that shows me the blocks deployed and created.
Each time I create new blocks the blocks get connected to any of the chains present in the Blockchain network..
